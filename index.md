## Research Associate, University of Cambridge
  
I completed a PhD in Economics at the University of Surrey in 2021 and am presently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of
Cambridge on the project Inference in Microeconometric Methods. My research interests are panel data econometrics, particularly factor models, spatial models and models of unobserved heterogeneity. A list of my working papers is given below and a copy of my CV can be found <strong><a href="{{ CV.pdf | prepend: '/assets/pdf/CV/CV.pdf' | relative_url | download }}">here</a></strong>.
