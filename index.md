## Welcome to my web page 

I am presently in the final stages of completing a PhD in Economics at the University of
Surrey, and have just taken up the position of Research Associate at the University of
Cambridge on the project `Inference in Microeconometric Methods', which is led by Dr
Koen Jochmans. My research interests are panel data econometrics, particularly factor models, spatial models and unobserved heterogenity.
