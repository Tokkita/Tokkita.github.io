#  Ayden Higgins
## Postdoctoral Researcher, University of Oxford 
I completed a PhD in Economics at the University of Surrey in 2021 and am presently working as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford. My research interests are panel data econometrics, particularly factor models, spatial models and models of unobserved heterogeneity. A catalogue of my research can be found below.
